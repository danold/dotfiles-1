# My dotfiles

## 2018-11-09
I haven't decided on a final structure or separation of concerns for these yet, but I thought it best to perform an initial commit sooner rather than later for backup purposes. As it stands now:

- `.zshrc` 
- `.zsh_aliases`
- `.zsh_powerlevel9k_default` has some sort-of-default theme settings

`.zshrc` contains almost all zsh configurations and sources `.zsh_aliases`. I'll begin now to reorganize and use zplug for plugin management.
